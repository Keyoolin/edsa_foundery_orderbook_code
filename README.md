#Readme file for orderbook analysis

This repository was created for the purpose of sharing code with my team members. The functions were created in the goal of being able to price financial assets using an orderbook.

All code has beed written by myself, with exception of the fetch_orderbook_continuously.py file.

If there are any issues with using the code, please let me know. If you find flaws within the source code, please advise. If you perhaps have a solution, I'd be grateful.

I am a Junior Data Scientist, and as such, the code might not be very efficient. If you have suggestions for me, please advise me. I love to improve on my understanding.
